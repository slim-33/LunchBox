# FreshPick v3.0 - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 What's New?

FreshPick now includes a **Fridge** feature that tracks all your scanned produce and helps you use items before they expire!

## 📱 App Navigation

### 4 Main Tabs (Left to Right):
1. **Scan** 🔍 - Scan produce (main landing page)
2. **Fridge** 📦 - Track all scanned items
3. **Collection** 📚 - Unique produce discovered
4. **Impact** 📊 - Your sustainability stats

## 🎯 How to Use the Fridge

### Scanning Items
1. Open the app (starts on Scan tab)
2. Take a photo of fresh produce
3. AI analyzes freshness with **harsh grading**:
   - 90-100: Perfect
   - 75-89: Very good
   - 55-74: OK, use soon
   - 35-54: Poor, use now
   - 0-34: Don't eat
4. Item automatically saved to Fridge & Collection

### Managing Your Fridge
1. Tap the **Fridge** tab
2. See two categories:
   - **Fresh** (≥3 days remaining) - Green badge
   - **Expiring Soon** (<3 days) - Orange badge
3. Each item shows:
   - Photo
   - Name
   - Days remaining
   - Storage tip
4. Tap trash icon to remove used items

### Generating Recipes
**Only appears when items are expiring soon!**

1. Go to Fridge tab
2. If items are expiring soon, you'll see "Get Recipe" button
3. Tap to generate a recipe using those ingredients
4. Recipe popup shows:
   - Recipe name
   - Ingredient list
   - Simple cooking steps
5. All recipes are 30 minutes or less!

## 💡 Tips

### Better Scanning
- Use good lighting
- Fill frame with produce
- One item at a time for best results
- Only fresh produce (no processed foods)

### Fridge Management
- Scan items when you buy them
- Delete items as you use them
- Check regularly for expiring items
- Use recipe feature to avoid waste

### Understanding Shelf Life
Shelf life is calculated from freshness score:
- 90-100 score → 10 days
- 75-89 score → 7 days
- 55-74 score → 4 days
- 35-54 score → 2 days
- Below 35 → 1 day

Days count down from when you scanned it!

## 🎨 Visual Guide

### Fridge Status Colors
- **Green** 🟢 = Fresh, 3+ days left
- **Orange** 🟠 = Expiring soon, use ASAP

### Collection vs Fridge
- **Collection**: Unique items you've discovered (one entry per type)
- **Fridge**: All items you've scanned (multiple entries allowed)

Example: Scan 3 apples
- Collection: 1 "Apple" entry
- Fridge: 3 separate apple entries

## ⚠️ What If...

### I scan something that's not produce?
You'll get a friendly message: "This doesn't appear to be fresh produce." Just try again with actual fruits or vegetables!

### The recipe button doesn't show?
That's normal! It only appears when you have items expiring soon (<3 days remaining).

### I want to clear all data?
Go to Dashboard → Settings → Clear All Data. This resets everything (Fridge, Collection, Stats).

### An item expired?
Delete it from your fridge manually. The app won't auto-delete to avoid confusion.

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Data Storage
- Everything stored on your device
- No cloud sync (privacy first!)
- Survives app restarts
- Can be manually cleared

### API Usage
- Scanning uses AI (requires API key)
- Recipe generation uses AI
- Both count toward your OpenRouter usage
- Free tier: ~200-500 scans/recipes

### Performance
- Fridge loads instantly
- Scanning takes 3-5 seconds
- Recipe generation takes 5-10 seconds
- No internet needed to view saved data
